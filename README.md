# Angular Single Page Application
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

## How to run the app

### Prerequisites
In order to run the app, you'll need to have the following installed on your computer:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. The Angular CLI. From the terminal, install the Angular CLI globally with: `npm install -g @angular/cli` 

You can run `npm --version` and `ng version` to check if you have these installed already.

### Steps
Once the prerequisites are met, you can follow these steps to run the app.
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Urga7/Angular_SPA` in the terminal. This will create a new folder and download the app's contents into it.
2. Run `cd Angular_SPA`.
3. Type `npm install`.
4. Run the application locally with `ng serve`.
5. In your browser of choice, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

If the default port 4200 is not available, you can specify another port with the port flag, for example:
`ng serve --port 4201`. To stop the app, press `Ctrl` + `c` in the termial.

If you don't have `git` installed, you can't download the zip file manually from `https://github.com/Urga7/Angular_SPA`, extract the contents and open the terminal in that folder. From there continue with step 3.
